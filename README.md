# Farcejuggler
A configuration driven project management tool

This project was bourne out of a little frustration with the excellent TaskJuggler. Namely difficulty in integrating it as a component into other systems. 
The limited reporting options. Some quibles with the core algorithm. 

Mostly it is just something to play around with for now.
